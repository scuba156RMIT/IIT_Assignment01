    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>My project idea is an application for Android based tablets that allows a
    child with autism to use the device in a safe and fun way while limiting the
    amount of sensory information being presented. It will be similar to a home
    screen replacement where the child can only access what is provided within
    the sandboxed application and other approved applications.</p>

    <p>The application aims to limit its use of sensory stimulus towards the
    child while encouraging them to learn within their capabilities and
    entertain them in a way that will help reduce frustration by the child.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>While there are applications available that aim to do similar things,
    such as Samsung Kids, they fail to meet the specific requirements of a child
    with autism and can often over stimulate them with sensory elements such as
    bright colours and loud audio. They also do not meet the educational
    requirements of an autistic child by assuming the education level of the
    child using the application.</p>

    <p>My own 8-year-old son has low-functioning autism spectrum disorder which
    brings a unique set of educational challenges for a child that does not
    speak or read and relies on pattern recognition. He absolutely loves using
    his tablets, but it can be extremely frustrating for him when certain
    actions occur that he is unfamiliar with, cannot work out how to proceed
    with the task the application is asking of him or plays stimulating
    audio/video that he is unexpecting.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The user interface will be simplistic by design, using minimal colour
    variations while avoiding ‘bright and loud’ colours, minimal sounds
    throughout the application, and easy to recognize icons that are not similar
    in shape or patterns. Word usage must be at a minimum so children that do
    not have the education level to read can still use the application with
    ease, while also understand what each action does. It must aim to achieve as
    little input from a parent as possible.</p>

    <p>The application will allow the launch of other apps that are tailored
    towards children with disabilities or ones that parents deem acceptable for
    their children to use. This will include educational applications as well as
    leisure actives such as games or media that is aimed at young children. Each
    category of apps will be separated into groups that are recognizable by the
    child using clear images. While parents will be able to allow any app they
    wish to be used by the child to be launched, there would be a whitelist of
    apps that are tailored towards education of children with autism that the
    parents can install by a simple install function, such as a store.</p>

    <p>While memorization can be key for the child to recognize and remember the
    functions of the application, some customization will be necessary to
    include so they can tailor it to the way they wish to use it. This must be
    easy for the child to access, while preventing accidental moving of icons as
    the child tries to use it to prevent any frustration from them.</p>

    <p>The child will be locked out of the android operating system for
    protection with a password or physical security such as fingerprint or
    facial recognition provided by the operating systems API. Parents need to
    feel secure about what their child is using and that they are not able to
    access anything that they should not be able to such as the internet without
    their consent.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

    <p>Development of the application will be done using the Java language in
    Android Studio. Sketch, or a Windows based equivalent such as Figma, can be
    used for the user interface design. A database will be required to store
    approved apps that can be launched, SQLite can be used so the application
    does not need to phone home.</p>

    <p>An android tablet device will be required for testing of the application.
    Targeting an older android version will be preferred to ensure more devices
    are capable of using the software.</p>

    <p>I have access to all the tools required, including Windows PC, MacOS, and
    an Android tablet, so availability of the tools will not be an issue.</p>

    <h2>Skills Required</h2>

    <p>Proficiency in Java software development will be necessary, as well as
    database and user interface design. Knowledge and experience with both
    children and autism will be highly valued as that it the key demographic for
    this application.</p>

    <p>Communication with third party app developers could be key in providing a
    safe space for the children, in which case communication skills will be
    needed to provide such relationships with them.</p>

    <p>While I have the software development skills to develop such an
    application, my design and communication skills are lacking which may
    require some outside help.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>

    <p>The outcome of the project would be an application that can help
    supplement the educational needs of children with autism, while also
    providing them entertainment without the anxiety and irritation currently
    occurring by both the child and the parent. This could have benefits to the
    child’s development if successful and improve their daily life quality.</p>

    <p>It would also be a great test of my capabilities in software development
    while providing an improvement towards my own child’s daily life that I
    could be proud of.</p>
