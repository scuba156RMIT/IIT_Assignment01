    <p>My name is Steven Holman. I am a 32 year old male living in Victoria,
      Australia, and am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology
      with RMIT. I have two children, with the youngest having low-function
      autism. My hobbies mostly include gaming, programming, and music. I
      practiced playing the guitar a lot when I was younger, and played in some
      bands, but I don’t find the time to pick up it up much these days.</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>My interest began with computers when I was young watching my brother
      build his own 486, which I found fascinating at the time, and watching him
      play games on it such as UFO Enemy Unknown and Civilization. I completed a
      Certificate IV in IT in 2006 and since then I have had an interest in
      programming. I have developed programs such as homebrew applications for the
      Xbox 360 console, mods for games, and have recently started to learn Unity
      for game development all within my own time teaching myself.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>This has now led to me looking to obtain the qualifications I need to
      start my career in the world of IT, which RMIT best leads me towards this
      path. I hope to increase the skills that I have already obtained and learn
      more about the areas of IT that I do not have any experience with.</p>

    <h2>Why did I choose to come to RMIT</h2>

    <p>I had studied at RMIT prior to starting this course and found it really
      welcoming with great support staff. Online study allows for flexibility to
      fit within my schedule so that I can complete my study in my own time
      without having to travel across the state to do it. RMIT is also known for
      its focus on technology which is something I am looking for.</p>

    <h2>What do I expect to learn</h2>

    <p>While I have had some previous study in the IT field, a lot of it has
      been self-taught especially with programming so I am really interested in
      expanding that knowledge and filling in the gaps. Some areas that I feel I
      lack in are software design patterns, test driven development, and security.
      I’ve previously focused on .Net development using C# as my language of
      choice, and feel getting more exposure to other languages such as Java would
      be highly beneficial to increasing my skill set.</p>

    <p>There are many other social aspects of Information Technology that I am
      not currently comfortable with, so it would be great to be able to expand on
      that and improve my social skills throughout this course.</p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>

    <p>Currently my ideal job would be a software developer for a game studio. I
      find this appealing as I have a great passion for video games, logic solving
      and my previous experience with Unity has been extremely fun to learn the
      skills for game development.</p>

    <p>This would include developing games using the Unity engine with C# or
      Unreal engine using C++, so experience with one of these game engines is
      needed. It would require a good understanding of game design, patterns and
      deployment to multiple systems such as PC, console and mobile devices.</p>

    <p>I currently have some experience with Unity and have been using C# for a
      number of years, including developing for PC, consoles as well as Android
      based devices. I have some understanding of design and patterns that are
      commonly used for software development.</p>

    <p>My plan to achieve this goal is to continue gaining more knowledge and
      experience using the Unity engine on my own free time, as well as learning
      about the standard practices utilized in designing games.</p>

    <p>This also includes continuing my study with RMIT to understand more about
      technology and how it applies to everyday life, along with a strong
      demonstration of my skills in software development. There may also be
      further study in the future to meet the skills needed and seeking employment
      as a junior software developer to gain experience in the field.</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

    <!-- <figure class="figure-center" style="height:25%;">
      <span style="height:100%;">
      <img src="images/myers-briggs-type.png" alt="Myers-Briggs type" style="height:100%; width:100%;">
    </span>
      <figcaption>My Myers-Briggs personality type</figcaption>
    </figure> -->

    <figure class="figure-right" style="width:32%; height:45%">
      <!-- <span style="height:91.5%"> -->
      <img style="height=90%" src="images/myers-briggs-breakdown.png" alt="Myers-Briggs breakdown">
      <!-- </span> -->
      <figcaption>Myers-Briggs breakdown</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <!-- <div class="clearfix"></div> -->

    <p>I feel that these results line up pretty well with what I have
      experienced throughout my life so far, with being an extremely introverted
      and shy person but also enjoying the occasional company of others. I am
      artistic, curious and always help others where I can, but find my own self
      esteem to be extremely low, get stressed easily and prefer to work on my
      own.</p>

    <p>I think this will make it difficult for me to integrate well into a team,
      especially with my social issues and shows that I have areas to improve on.
      Communication and planning is key in working with a team, which will require
      me to rely on others for these areas while I bring my own set of skills to
      contribute to the team.</p>
